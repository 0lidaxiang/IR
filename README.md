# IR
This is the homeworks of NTUST CSIE IR course in  2017.
Homework3, homework4 and homework5 will test result in Kaggle website.

# sourceData
This is the data files that should be put in data or source floder of homework1,homework3,homework4,homework5.

## Homework1
This program is right.  
Vector Model.

## Homework2
This program is right.  
Compute MAP.

## Homework3
This program is wrong.EM Algorithm maybe right.  
EM Algorithm.

## Homework4
This program result effect is bad.Algorithm maybe right.
Rocchio Algorithm applying in IR system.

## Homework5
This program is right. But the keras train maybe not right.The CBOW result may be better only need 20~50 times train. My 2500 times train's good result is just a coincidence.And maybe we should given the word in query but not in document the socre of the three lowest TF_IDF socre, teacher's advice.

Our goal is to implement a word embedding method by using Keras, and then you should leverage the learned embeddings to do retrieval.
Use CBOW, word embeddings, One-hot, Vector model. And we also can use Rocchio Algorithm to imporve the result's MAP.
