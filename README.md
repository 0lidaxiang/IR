# sourceData
This is the data that shoubl be put in data or source floder in homework1,homework3,homework4.

## Homework1
This program is right.  
Vector Model.

## Homework2
This program is right.  
Compute MAP.

## Homework3
This program is wrong.EM Algorithm maybe right.  
EM Algorithm.

## Homework4
This program result effect is bad.Algorithm maybe right.
Rocchio Algorithm applying in IR system.

## Homework5
This program is right.  
Our goal is to implement a word embedding method by using Keras, and then you should leverage the learned embeddings to do retrieval.
Use CBOW, word embeddings, One-hot, Vector model. And we also can use Rocchio Algorithm to imporve the result's MAP.
